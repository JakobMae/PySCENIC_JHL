This is code on how to apply the [PySCENIC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0336-2) pipeline on pre-annotated snRNA-seq data from [Velmeshev et al](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7678724/)

This was created by Jakob MÃ¤eots during his internship at the Hjerling-Leffler lab at Karolinska Institutet over a period of 10 weeks

In the notebooks folder are all the original notebooks that I created to learn coding and computational analysis.
In the scripts folder are the finalised scripts that are ready to use for SCENIC analysis
